// Polyfills

/*
Polyfills are JavaScript libraries that provide functionality that is not natively available in the current environment or browser. 
They are used to add new features to older browsers or platforms that do not support them natively.

Why Use Polyfills?
1. Cross-Browser Compatibility: Polyfills allow you to write code that works the same across different browsers.
2. Performance Optimization: Polyfills can improve the performance of your code, especially in older browsers.
3. Accessibility: Polyfills can help make your code more accessible to users with disabilities.
